# coursera-ml

Part of exercises for Coursera Specialization in Machine Learning (University of Washington). I used pandas and scikit-learn to do these exercises.

The datasets, files, and starter codes for all the exercises can be found <a href="https://github.com/learnml/machine-learning-specialization">here</a>. 

* sentiment_logistic_classification: classifying reviews of Amazon's baby products into positive or negative  sentiments using logistic regression. Also, an implementation of the gradient ascent algorithm for fitting the model's weights with L2 regularization.
